# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Notes - Day 01

Welcome to **Day 01** of my **Ethical Hacking** journey!  
This file summarizes key foundational concepts related to hacking, cybersecurity, attack types, hacker categories, industry acronyms, and more.

## 🔍 What is Hacking?

Hacking is the act of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems or networks to gain unauthorized access or control.  
It can be used for malicious intent or ethical purposes (security testing).

# 🔍 What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical hacking** is the **authorized and legal practice** of testing a computer system, network, or application to find security vulnerabilities **before malicious hackers can exploit them**.
It involves using the **same tools and techniques** as cybercriminals, but with **permission** and a **goal to improve security**.
Ethical hackers, often called **White Hat hackers**, help organizations:

- ✅ **Identify and fix security flaws**
- 🔒 **Strengthen defenses against cyberattacks**
- 📋 **Comply with legal and regulatory standards**
- 🚫 **Prevent data breaches and financial loss**

🛡️ In short: Ethical hacking is **hacking for good** — using hacking skills to protect, not to harm.

## 🧑‍💻 Types of Hackers

| Type           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| White Hat      | Ethical hackers who test and secure systems with permission.                |
| Black Hat      | Malicious hackers who break into systems for illegal or harmful reasons.   |
| Grey Hat       | Hackers who operate both ethically and unethically, depending on the case. |
| Red Team       | Offensive professionals who simulate real-world attacks on organizations.  |
| Blue Team      | Defensive professionals who detect, respond, and defend against threats.   |
| Purple Team    | A collaborative group combining Red and Blue teams to improve defenses.    |
| Script Kiddies | Inexperienced hackers using pre-made tools without understanding them.     |
| Hacktivists    | Hackers driven by political, environmental, or social causes.              |

## 🔐 What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity involves protecting networks, systems, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or theft.

### 🎯 Goal:
To ensure the **CIA Triad**:
- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized users access data.
- **Integrity** – Data remains accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability** – Systems are accessible when needed.

## 💣 Types of Attacks (with Descriptions)

| Attack Type       | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Phishing**      | Tricking users into revealing sensitive information via fake emails/websites. |
| **Malware**       | Malicious software (viruses, worms, trojans) that damages or steals data. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** | Intercepting communication between two parties to steal or alter data. |
| **SQL Injection** | Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases and extract data. |
| **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** | Flooding a server with traffic to crash it or make it unavailable. |
| **Brute Force**   | Repeatedly trying passwords or keys to gain access. |
| **Zero-Day Exploit** | Attacking systems using newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches exist. |

## 🧾 Few Cybersecurity Acronyms

| Acronym | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **POC** | *Proof of Concept* – A demo showing that a vulnerability can be exploited. |
| **IR**  | *Incident Response* – A structured approach to handle and manage security breaches. |
| **SOC** | *Security Operations Center* – A centralized unit that monitors and responds to threats. |
| **SaaS**| *Security as a Service* – Cloud-based delivery of security services. |
| **HID** | *Host-based Intrusion Detection* – Monitoring a single system for suspicious activity. |
| **IPS** | *Intrusion Prevention System* – Identifies and automatically blocks threats in real time. |

## ⚔️ Phases of a Cyber Attack

1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering information about the target (footprinting).
2. **Scanning** – Identifying open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
3. **Gaining Access** – Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the system.
4. **Maintaining Access** – Installing backdoors or rootkits for persistence.
5. **Clearing Tracks** – Erasing logs and evidence to avoid detection.

## 📝 Extra Info

## 📘 What is a `README.md`?

A `README.md` is a markdown file used to introduce, explain, or document a project, folder, or set of notes.  
It's typically the first file someone reads when visiting a repository.

### 🧾 Basic Markdown Syntax:

- `#` Heading 1  
- `##` Heading 2  
- `**bold**`, `*italic*`  
- Lists: `-` or `*`  
- Code block: Use triple backticks (```)  
- Tables: Use `|` and `---`
