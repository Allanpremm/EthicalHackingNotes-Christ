# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking – Day 06  
## Topic: Different Hacking Tools  

### 1. 🔎 Reconnaissance Tools
These tools are used in the information gathering phase to collect data about targets.  
- **Nmap** – Network scanner for open ports, services, and OS detection.  
- **Recon-ng** – Web reconnaissance framework for gathering information.  
- **Maltego** – Data mining & visualization for links between people, domains, emails, etc.  
- **Shodan** – Search engine for devices connected to the internet.  

---

### 2. 🌐 Scanning & Enumeration Tools
Used to actively probe and map the target environment.  
- **Nessus** – Vulnerability scanner for identifying system weaknesses.  
- **OpenVAS** – Open-source vulnerability assessment system.  
- **Nikto** – Web server scanner for outdated software & misconfigurations.  
- **Enum4linux** – Enumeration tool for Windows/Samba systems.  

---

### 3. 🛠️ Exploitation Tools
Used to gain unauthorized access by exploiting vulnerabilities.  
- **Metasploit Framework** – Most popular exploitation framework.  
- **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)** – Focused on client-side web browser attacks.  
- **SQLmap** – Automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection.  
- **Aircrack-ng** – Wireless network cracking tool.  

---

### 4. 🕵️‍♂️ Sniffing & Spoofing Tools
Used for intercepting and manipulating network traffic.  
- **Wireshark** – Packet analyzer for monitoring network activity.  
- **Tcpdump** – Command-line network packet analyzer.  
- **Ettercap** – Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack tool.  
- **Cain & Abel** – Password recovery & ARP spoofing tool (Windows).  

---

### 5. 🔐 Password Cracking Tools
Used to recover or crack passwords through brute force, dictionary, or hash attacks.  
- **John the Ripper** – Popular fast password cracker.  
- **Hydra** – Parallelized login cracker for many protocols.  
- **Hashcat** – Advanced GPU-based password cracking tool.  
- **Medusa** – Speedy brute-force login cracker.  

---

### 6. 🎭 Social Engineering Tools
Used to exploit human weaknesses through psychological manipulation.  
- **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)** – Automates phishing, credential harvesting, etc.  
- **MSFvenom** – Payload generator for malicious executables.  
- **Evilginx2** – Phishing framework for capturing credentials & session tokens.  

---

### 7. 📂 Post-Exploitation Tools
Used after gaining access to maintain persistence or extract further data.  
- **Mimikatz** – Extracts Windows credentials and hashes.  
- **Netcat** – Known as the “Swiss Army knife of networking,” for backdoors & communication.  
- **Empire** – Post-exploitation framework with PowerShell agents.  

---

### 8. 📊 Reporting & Analysis Tools
Used to document and analyze findings.  
- **Dradis** – Framework for sharing information among penetration testers.  
- **Faraday** – Collaborative penetration test environment.  
- **KeepNote** – Simple note-taking tool for pen testers.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
On **Day 06**, I explored various categories of hacking tools used in ethical hacking.  
- Reconnaissance tools help in gathering information.  
- Scanning tools find vulnerabilities.  
- Exploitation and sniffing tools are used to attack targets.  
- Password cracking and social engineering tools exploit human/system weaknesses.  
- Post-exploitation and reporting tools ensure persistence and documentation.  

📌 These tools, when used **ethically**, help penetration testers secure systems by identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them.
